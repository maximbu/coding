/**
 *You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.

 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
 cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
 A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
 configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
 invalid.
 Return the ans % 10000003
